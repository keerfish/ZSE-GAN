# Visual Enhancement of image stacks from Z-Scanning Microscope using ZSE-GAN
Z-stack scanning captures a series of 2D images for each individual physical tissue section, but these images often suffer from typical blurring effects. The processing data consists of a set of image stacks, as illustrated below.
**Note:** 
i. S_05 to S_25 are images taken by changing the depth of the focus within the brain slice.
ii. S_01 to S_04 are images taken by focusing above the brain slice.
iii. S_26 to S_29 are images taken by focusing below the brain slice.
iv. S_14, S_15 and S_16 are sharp in-focus images.
